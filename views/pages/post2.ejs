My Journey Into the MERN Stack.<br>
<p>I am learning Node.js, Express.js, and I have just started exploring React. I haven not learned MongoDB yet — but that is next on my list!
And honestly? I think this step-by-step approach feels much better.</p>

<h4>💻 Starting with Node.js & Express</h4>

<p>Learning Node.js helped me understand how JavaScript works on the server.
With Express.js, I started building routes, handling requests, and rendering pages.

At first, backend concepts felt confusing — especially things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Routing</li>
  <li>Middleware</li>
  <li>Handling form data</li>
  <li>Connecting frontend with backend</li>
</ul>

<p>But after building small projects, it slowly started making sense.</p>

<h4>⚛️ Just Started React</h4>

<p>Now I have begun learning React, and it feels very different from traditional HTML.

Components, props, state — everything is new.
But I am excited because React makes building interactive UIs much more powerful.

I know it will take time to understand deeply, but I am enjoying the process.</p>

<h4>🗄️ MongoDB Is Next</h4>

I havenot learned MongoDB yet, but I understand it is used for storing data.

My plan is simple:
First understand frontend and backend clearly,
then learn how to connect everything with a database.

One step at a time.

<h4>🌱 What I have Learned So Far</h4>

<p>I realized something important:

You dont need to learn the whole MERN stack in one week.

It is okay to feel confused, take breaks, learn slowly, and build small projects.

What matters is consistency.</p>

<h4>💬 Final Thoughts</h4>

<p>I am still learning. Still making mistakes. Still growing.

If you are also starting your MERN journey, don’t rush.
Master one part, then move to the next.

We will get there — step by step.</p>

<h4>🚀 Learn. Build. Repeat.</h4>


<h4>Add a comment here!</h4>

<form action="/comments/<%= post.id %>" method="post">
  <input type="text" name="comment" placeholder="add comment here!">
  <button type="submit">Submit your comment</button>
</form>

<% if(post.comments && post.comments.length > 0) {%>

<h2>Comments:</h2>

<ul>
<% post.comments.forEach(c => { %>

  <li>
    <%= c %>
  </li>

</ul>
