My Journey Learning JavaScript

When I first started learning JavaScript, I felt completely confused.
After HTML and CSS, everything suddenly looked complicated — variables, functions, errors… it was overwhelming.

<h4>My first line of code was:

console.log("Hello World");</h4>

<p>It looked simple, but seeing it work in the browser console felt amazing. That small moment gave me confidence.

I struggled a lot in the beginning. Sometimes a tiny mistake would break everything, and I wouldnot understand why. But slowly, step by step, things started making sense.

The first time I made a button show an alert message, I felt so proud. My website was no longer just design — it became interactive.

I am still learning every day. And if you are a beginner too, just remember:

You dnot have to understand everything at once.
Just learn one small thing today — and keep building.</p>

<h4>🚀 Learn. Build. Repeat.</h4>


<h4>Add a comment here</h4>

<form action="/comments/<%= post.id %>" method="post">
  <input type="text" name="comment" placeholder="add comment here!">
  <button type="submit">Submit your comment</button>
</form>



<% if(post.comments && post.comments.length > 0) {%>


<h2>Comments:</h2>
<ul>
<% post.comments.forEach(c => { %>

  <li>
    <%= c %>
  </li>


<% }) %>
</ul>

<% } %>
